## Description
A simple C#/ASP.NET API built to be used as the backend for a social media application where users can create an account and upload a profile picture. The models were built to be used with MS SQL Server and the application is deployed to Azure. The front end of this application is currently being built to consume the API using primarily Kotlin. You can find the repository for that [here](https://github.com/garretthilberling/csharp-fullstack-frontend-kotlin). Languages, frameworks, and methodologies used to produce this application include: C#, ASP.NET, MVC File Structure, MS SQL Server, MS Azure, and a platform called Treblle for monitoring of API calls.

## Usage
Here is a demonstration of how to use this app:

</div>

## Installation
To use this API make your calls using the following deployed Azure URL: treblleapp.azurewebsites.net/ (will soon be populated with frontend code)
